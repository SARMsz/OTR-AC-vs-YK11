<h1>OTR-AC vs YK11 – I Tested Both, Here's What Happened</h1>

<p>I recently ran full cycles of <strong>OTR-AC</strong> and <strong>YK11</strong> back-to-back to see how they really compare. Both of these are powerful muscle-builders, but they hit totally different. In this post, I’ll give you the exact results I got, what side effects I noticed, and which one I’d actually use again depending on the goal—<strong>cutting, bulking, or strength-focused training</strong>.</p>

<p>At the end of each section, I’ve linked the exact sources I used—these are trusted and tested, not random research chem sites.</p>

<h2>What Is OTR-AC (Ostarine-O-Acetate)?</h2>

<p><strong>OTR-AC</strong> is a modified version of <strong>Ostarine MK-2866</strong>. It’s acetylated for longer activity and stronger anabolic action. That makes it a cleaner option for recomp or lean gains. I ran it at <strong>15mg/day for 6 weeks</strong> during a body recomposition phase (eating at maintenance with heavy training).</p>

<h3>My OTR-AC Experience:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Harder muscle look after Week 2</li>
  <li>More noticeable vascularity than regular Ostarine</li>
  <li>Strength improved slowly but steadily</li>
  <li>Endurance bump was real—longer workouts, less fatigue</li>
  <li>Zero water retention, dry look</li>
</ul>

<p>I honestly liked it more than traditional Ostarine. It felt like a middle ground between Osta and RAD140. Great for recomping and light strength gains with almost no suppression.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Leaner gains with visible hardness</li>
  <li>Minimal to no suppression at low doses</li>
  <li>Enhanced endurance</li>
  <li>No bloating or estrogen-like sides</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Not strong enough for bulking alone</li>
  <li>Slow progress—needs consistent training/diet</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Recomp, Cutting, Muscle Hardening</p>

<h2>YK11 – Still One of the Most Powerful SARMs I've Used</h2>

<p><strong>YK11</strong> is often called a myostatin inhibitor, though technically it’s a synthetic steroidal SARM. I used it during a <strong>lean bulk at 10mg/day for 6 weeks</strong>, eating about 500 calories over maintenance. It’s hands-down one of the strongest SARMs I’ve cycled.</p>

<h3>My YK11 Experience:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Rapid strength gains (squats +30lbs, bench +20lbs)</li>
  <li>Increased muscle fullness and density</li>
  <li>Pumps were insane, especially during push days</li>
  <li>Slight joint dryness—upped my collagen and water</li>
  <li>Suppression kicked in by week 4</li>
</ul>

<p>YK11 works, no doubt—but it’s not beginner-friendly. It’s strong, and it requires a good support setup (liver, joints, possible mini-PCT). But if you’ve used SARMs before and want to bulk fast, this one delivers.</p>

<p><strong>✅ Pros:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fast and visible muscle growth</li>
  <li>Huge strength improvements</li>
  <li>Works very well for bulking</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>❌ Cons:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Moderate suppression after a few weeks</li>
  <li>May cause joint discomfort in dry lifters</li>
  <li>Requires PCT</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Best For:</strong> Bulking, Strength Gains, Advanced Users</p>

<h2>OTR-AC vs YK11 – Side-by-Side Comparison</h2>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>SARM</th>
      <th>Best Use</th>

    <tr>

<p>So here’s the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you want a <strong>mild cycle with clean gains</strong> and low risk, go with <strong>OTR-AC</strong>.</li>
  <li>If you want to <strong>bulk fast and lift heavier</strong>, and you’re okay handling suppression and recovery—<strong>YK11 is the move</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Testing Protocol</h2>

<p>I test all SARMs solo—no stacks, no nonsense. Just one compound at a time, with bloodwork before and after, clean diet, and consistent lifts. I track:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bodyweight & lean mass (DEXA scan)</li>
  <li>Strength on 5 core lifts</li>
  <li>Endurance & recovery</li>
  <li>Sleep, libido, energy</li>
</ul>

<p>YK11 crushed strength and size. OTR-AC gave better definition and tightness. Totally different tools for different jobs.</p>

<h2>FAQs – OTR-AC vs YK11</h2>

<h3>Is OTR-AC stronger than regular Ostarine?</h3>
<p>Yes. It’s more potent per mg, offers harder gains, and better endurance.</p>

<h3>Does OTR-AC cause suppression?</h3>
<p>Very little. At 15mg/day, I didn’t need any PCT. Still do bloodwork to be sure.</p>

<h3>How long does it take for YK11 to kick in?</h3>
<p>Usually by Week 2. Strength and size gains start showing fast.</p>

<h3>Can you stack OTR-AC with YK11?</h3>
<p>Technically yes, but I wouldn’t. YK11 is strong enough. Stacking increases suppression and joint risk.</p>

<h3>Which one has fewer side effects?</h3>
<p><strong>OTR-AC</strong>. It’s much milder, no real crash, and easier to recover from.</p>

<h2>Final Verdict – Which Should You Use?</h2>

<p>Both SARMs are legit, but they serve different goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>OTR-AC</strong> is perfect if you want a safe, dry, low-side-effect SARM to harden up during
